### 🛠️ What I Can Help You With
Code that runs, scales, and holds up under pressure.  
I work with teams that care about shipping real products — fast, clean, and secure. Whether you're building something from scratch or need help scaling an existing project, here’s what I bring to the table:

##
### 💡 Smart Contract Development (Solidity)
Building on Ethereum or any SVM/EVM-compatible chain?  
I write production-grade smart contracts — clean, tested, and secure. From tokens to custom protocols, I help turn blockchain ideas into working code.

##
### ⚙️ Backend Engineering (TypeScript)
Need a rock-solid backend for your app?  
I build maintainable, high-performance APIs, background jobs, and integrations — all powered by TypeScript and shaped around your product’s needs.

##
### 🧠 Applied AI & Automation
Want to integrate AI into your product or workflow?  
I help teams use large language models (LLMs) in practical, focused ways — from retrieval-based chatbots to internal tools that actually save time. Whether it’s OpenAI, open-source models, or something custom, I can help you ship fast and smart.

##
### 🔐 Security Reviews & Audits
Security isn’t just a service — it’s how I think.  
Every line of code I write is shaped by years of experience spotting vulnerabilities and thinking like an attacker. While I don’t audit everything, I do offer targeted security reviews for EVM smart contracts — with a deep focus on logic flaws, reentrancy, and edge-case exploits.

Whether you’re prepping for mainnet or want a second set of eyes before launch, I’ll help you ship with confidence.

##
### 🎯 Custom Work? Let’s Talk.
Got something outside the box?  
I’m open to new ideas and weird problems — whether it's AI tooling, automation scripts, or internal systems. If it’s technically interesting, I’m all ears.
