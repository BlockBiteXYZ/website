Hey, I’m Mathias — a Swiss developer with 10+ years of experience across IT, automation, and emerging tech.  
I’m based in Switzerland and bring that same Swiss mindset to my work: precision, reliability, and a focus on quality that lasts. Whether it’s smart contracts, backends, or AI tooling, I help teams turn ambitious ideas into robust, secure software.

##
### 🛠️ What I Do
**Custom Development**
From smart contracts to AI integrations, I build tailored solutions that meet unique business needs.

**DevOps & Automation**
CI/CD, Kubernetes, ArgoCD, Github Actions, ... — I help teams streamline and scale with confidence and in their preferred tooling.

**Security-Focused Engineering**
I take software security seriously. Whether it’s smart contract audits or designing fault-tolerant infrastructure, I build with safety in mind.
  
##
### 🧰 Tools & Technologies
**Languages**: TypeScript, Solidity, Python, and a little bit of Rust

**Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, ArgoCD, Terraform, Github Actions, CircleCI, and many more

**Mindset**: Clean code, automation, and always learning

### 🚀 Selected Projects
**[Frankencoin CCIP Integration](https://github.com/Frankencoin-ZCHF/FrankenCoin)**  
Brought the Swiss Franc–backed stablecoin (ZCHF) to multiple chains with Chainlink CCIP integration.

**[Frankencoin Smart Contract Audit](/audits/Frankencoin.pdf)**  
Conducted a full security review of the initial ZCHF contract system, uncovering critical minting and challenge vulnerabilities — and worked with the team to address them.

**RAG-based AI Chatbot @ TX Group**  
Built an internal AI assistant that helps employees get instant answers from internal documentation using Retrieval-Augmented Generation and natural language processing.

If you're building something ambitious and need a sharp dev who can think through both the code and the architecture — we should talk.
